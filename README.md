# Java bindings to the Wasmtime runtime engine

WASM, web-assembly, is a low-level stack execution engine. This library gives a JNI based binding to the Wasmtime WASM runtime.

For more information, please see [github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime).

This is very early stages. All interfaces are subject to change.

## Building

Use the provided Makefile.

Ensure tools are installed:

```shell
> make init
```

Run tests:

```shell
> make test
```

## Structure

The Java is meant to be as minimal as possible. All Wasmtime object references are stored in Java objects as opaque pointers (longs). The safety in this area has not yet been proven. Thread safety in particular is non-existent. The WasmEngine should be safe to share across threads, though we should most likely introduce a custom clone method for this purpose.

### Adding new native methods

The Java compiler will automatically output the headers for the JNI bindings based on the native methods defined in the various classes. While the headers generated by the Java compiler aren't directly used during the Rust JNI compilation, they are useful for seeing the C signature that the Rust needs to export. The files can be found in `target/generated-sources/*.h`.
